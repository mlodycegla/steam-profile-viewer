# steam-profile-viewer

First commit!
---

This little website is a project done for my one month challange where I program applications or write websites every day for one moth

It displays information about someones steam profile

It's pretty broken so not every steam profile will work

And an important thing to mention is that it may not work at all because of CORS, to fix this simply download a browser extension that bypasses CORS and then it will work properly

How to use?

First of all you will need a steamID.
Where to find it?

It is the highlighted text on the image.
Next you copy this text to the form in left upper corner of the website, paste it and refresh the website.
